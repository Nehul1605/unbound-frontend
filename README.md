# 📘 Unbound

**Unbound** is an interactive documentation platform that transforms **static PDF textbooks** into **dynamic, web-based learning experiences**.

Instead of reading PDFs page by page, Unbound restructures content into **navigable sections, interactive modules, and contextual explanations**, making learning faster, clearer, and more engaging.
